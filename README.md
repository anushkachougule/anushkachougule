<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anushka Chougule</h1>
<h3 align="center">Aspiring Data Scientist| Data Science & Analytics Enthusiast</h3>

If thereâ€™s one thing I love, itâ€™s finding stories hidden in data. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Information Management at the University of Maryland, where I specialize in Data Science & Analytics. But my journey with data started much earlierâ€”back in my Computer Engineering days at Pune University, where I realized that numbers arenâ€™t just numbers; they reveal insights, trends, and sometimes, things we never even thought to look for.

I thrive on solving puzzles, whether itâ€™s through machine learning models, predictive analytics, or compelling visualizations. My toolkit includes Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, and I enjoy experimenting with data to find patterns that drive smarter decisions. One of my favorite projects involved uncovering trends in Formula 1 racing data, blending my love for analytics with my fascination for the sport.
Beyond the numbers, I believe data is most powerful when itâ€™s understoodâ€”thatâ€™s why I love creating visual stories that bring complex insights to life. Iâ€™m now looking for full-time opportunities in data analytics where I can combine my technical skills with my curiosity to make an impact.

If youâ€™re working on exciting projects, have insights to share, or just love a good data conversationâ€”letâ€™s connect!
